ðŸ‘Œ: *traditions*: things that are done just because.

ðŸ‘€: *attention*: things that we don't fully understand yet.

ðŸ”¥: *lit*: self-explanatory.

ðŸ¦†: *undefined*: [things that are *implementation-defined* or *undefined* by c.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2397984/undefined-unspecified-and-implementation-defined-behavior).

# Chapter 2:

### Section 2-1: Variable Names
* Rules:
  1. names can only contain letters & digits & _ which counts as a letter.
  2. names are case sensitive.
  3. ðŸ‘Œ: lowercase letters for c variable names and all uppercase for symbolic constants.
  4. ðŸ”¥: only first 31 characters are significant for internal names.
  5. external names: 6 characters all single case guaranteed by the standard.
### Section 2-2: Data Types & Sizes
* Data Types:
  1. __char:__ 1 bytle, holds one character in the local set.
  2. __int:__ integer, reflecting the natural size on the host machine.
  3. __float:__ single precision floating point.
  4. __double:__ double precision floating point.
* Qualifiers:
  1. __short & long:__ integers only! a short is at least 16 bits, while long is at least 32 bits. short < int < long! These sizes are specified by our compiler for our target hardware.
  2. __signed & unsigned:__ integer, or char! Unsigned numbers are always positive and are 0-255, signed numbers are -128  to +127. Printable characters are always positive, but a plain "char c" call's sign is machine dependent.
* Standard Headers:
  1. ðŸ‘€ __<limits.h>:__ determines various properties of the various variable types.
  2. ðŸ‘€ __<float.h>:__ contains a set of various platform-dependent constants related to floating point values.
  3. both of these standard headers contain symbolic constants for data type sizes & more machine/compiler properties.
### Section 2-3: Constants
* Types of constants:
  1. int = 1234;
  2. long = 123456789L; //any int too big to fit will automatically upgrade to *long*
  3. unsigned long = 21830981UL; //denoted by the U
  4. double = 1.234; double = 1e-2;
  5. float = 1.234F; float = 1e-2F; float = 2F; //is a double unless suffixed with F.
  6. long double = 1.234L; //any decimal suffixed with L becomes long double.
  7. octal = 037; //prefixed with a leading 0.
  8. hexadecimal = 0x1f; //prefixed with '0x'.
  9. long hexadecimal = 0x1ffa82bL; //suffixed with L becomes long hexadecimal
  10. unsigned long hexadecimal = 0xfUL; //suffixed with UL makes this an unsigned long constant with value 15 decimal.
  11. char = '0'; //char constants are equal to the numeric value of the char. char '0' numerically is 48. This depends on the character set.
* Escape Sequences / Escape Characters:
  1. '\a' = alert;
  2. '\b' = backspace;
  3. '\f' = formfeed;
  4. '\n' = newline;
  5. '\r' = carriage return;
  6. '\t' = horizontal tab;
  7. '\v' = vertical tab;
  8. '\\' = backslash;
  9. '\?' = question mark;
  10. '\'' = single quotes;
  11. '\"' = double quotes;
  12. '\ooo' = 1-3 octal digits.
  13. '\xhh' = 1-2 hexidecimal digits.
  14. '\0' = null/escape character;
* Constant Expressions
  0. ðŸ‘€ __Expression:__ any legal combination of symbols that represent a value.
  1. constant expressions is any expression that involves only constants.
  2. string constants or string literals are represented as "I am a string" or "". 
  3. ðŸ”¥: constant expressions may sometimes be evaluated, (strings: concatenated), during __compilation__ as opposed to __runtime__. It just depends on the compiler & machine.
  4. ðŸ”¥: strings are just arrays of characters delimited by double quotes "" & terminated by a '\0' null character.
  5. ðŸ‘€ __<string.h>__: contains useful string functions such as __strlen(s)__ which returns the length of a string array.
* Enumerator constant
  1. list of constant integer values such as:
  2. ðŸ”¥: *unspecified enumerator values* begin at 0, and increase by 1 for the following value.
  3. ex: enum boolean { NO, YES }; //NO = 0, YES = 1; 
  4. ex: enum escapes { BELL = '\a', BACKSPACE = '\b', TAB = '\t', NEWLINE = '\n', VTAB = '\v', RETURN = '\r' }; 
  5. ðŸ‘Œ: enumerators are usually better than defines because we have the values generated for us *and* enum type variables offer us the opportunity to be checked by the compiler one last time.
### Section 2.4: Declarations
* Rules:
  1. All variables must be declared before use.
  2. __Declaration:__ specifies a type and contains a list of 1 or more variables. ex *int lower, upper* or *char c[1000]*;
  3. __Initialization:__ setting the intial value for a variable done only once before program execution or function call.
  4. You can initialize a variable when you declare it. ex *char esc = '\0';* or *int i = 0;*.
  5. Initializers may be expressions.
  6. External & Static variables are initialized to 0 by default.
  7. The *qualifier* __const__ can be added to the declaration of a variable and denotes that the following variable will not be altered.
  8. ðŸ”¥: A __const__ declaration w/ array arguments indicates the function does not change the array. 
  9. ðŸ¦†: the result when an attempt to make a change to a const is undefined by c .
  
### Section 2.5: Arithmetic Operators
* Binary Arithmetic Operators:
  1. +, -, * , /, % (modulus).
  2. ðŸ”¥: Integer division truncates any fractional part. 
  3. ðŸ¦†The direction of truncation for / is undefined by c. (The direction is whether it rounds up or down) 
  4. ðŸ”¥: % (*Modulus*) __cannot__ be applied to type *float* or *double*.
* ðŸ‘€ Precedence Order (1 < 2 < 3 < 4):
  1. Binary +, - operators.
  2. Binary * , /, and & (modulus).
  3. Unary + and -
  4. ðŸ”¥: Arithmetic operators associate [left to right](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25589257/what-does-left-to-right-associativity-mean). 
### Section 2.6: Relational & Logical Operators
* Relational Operators:
  1. \>, >=, <, <=
* Equality Operators:
  1. ==, !=
* Logical Operators:
  1. &&, ||
  2. Evaluated left to right.
  3. ðŸ”¥: Evaluation stops when the truth or falsehood is known. *(Lazy programming paradigms++;)*
* ðŸ‘€ Precedence Order:
  1. Relational Operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators. ex: *i < lim-1* is the same as *i < (lim-1)*
    * *translation:* We would expect arithmetic operators in an expression to be evaluated first.
  2. Relational Operators have a higher precedence than equality operators.
  3. ðŸ”¥: && precedence is higher than ||
  4. Ex: *(i < lim-1 && (c=getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF)* In *(c=getchar()) != '\n'* we use parenthesis to ensure that c = getchar() is completed first. != has a higher precedence than the assignment =.
  5. The numeric value of 1 is true, 0 is false. How we would expect it to be.
  6. *!* as a unary operator acts as a 'not'. Changes 0 => 1 && 1 => 0
### Section 2.7: Type Conversions
* Rules
  0. ðŸ”¥__Explicit Conversions (casting):__ '(cast) expression'
      * *note: casting acts as if we had just redeclared & intialized the variable to the new type of cast.*
  1. ðŸ”¥: In general automatic conversions will go from narrower to wider without losing info. (int -> float)
  2. Expressions that don't make sense are not allowed.
  3. Expressions that lose information will provide a warning. long => short.
  4. Type conversions take place during assignments: __value__ of the *right* is converted to the __type__ of the *left*.
  5. __Sign Extension:__ [perserving the numbers sign by extending its leftmost bit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_extension)
  6. Larger integers are converted to smaller integers by dropping *excess higher order bits*.
  7. Type conversions take place when arguments are passed to functions.
      * function prototypes automatically cast arguments to the specified type.
* Char Expressions:
  1. ðŸ”¥: Chars are just domesticated ints.
  2. ðŸ¦†: undefined specification by c of whether char's are unsigned or signed.
  3. ðŸ‘€: Char signed/unsigned guarantees: 
     * printing characters are always positive
     * characters in expressions are always positive.
     * arbitrary bit patterns stored as a character variable? who knows!
  4. ðŸ‘Œ: __always specify signed or unsigned char values!__
 * Relational Expressions (&&, >, ==, etc):
  1. they will have a value of 1 if true and 0 if false when evaluated.
  2. For a value of *true* we simply mean *non-zero*.
* Arithmetic Conversions
  1. if the operands are different types => *lower* is __promoted__ to *higher* __before__ the operation begins.
  2. ðŸ‘€: __General Rules Of Conversions:__
      * If either operand is long double, convert the other to long double. 
      * Otherwise, if either operand is double, convert the other to double. 
      * Otherwise, if either operand is float, convert the other to float. 
      * Otherwise, convert char and short to int. 
      * Then, if either operand is long, convert the other to long. 
      * *Detailed information can be found in Section 6 of Appendix A*;
  3. ðŸ¦†: signed and unsigned comparisons are undefined by c.
* ðŸ‘€ <ctype.h>
  1. Gives us helper functions, *tests & conversions*, that are independent of the character set like ASCII.
  2. isdigit(c) - checks if a value is a #
  3. lower(c) - makes a letter lowercase.
### Section 2.8: Increment & Decrement Operators.
  1. ++n: increments n __before__ the value is used. *prefix*
  2. n++: increments n __after__ the value is used. *suffix*
### Section 2.9: Bitwise Operators
  1. &, | (or), ^ (xor), <<, >>, ~(ones compliment)
  2. << left shift is equivalent to * 2(n) where n is how many bits we left shift by.
  3. ðŸ¦†: the bits pushed onto the number with right shifting is undefined by c.
### Section 2.10: Assignment Operators & Expressions
  1. expr1 op= expr2 is equivalent to  expr1 = (expr1) op (expr2)
        * Where op can be any of:   +   -   *   /   %   <<   >>   &   ^   |
### Section 2.11: Conditional Expressions
  1. expr1 ? expr2 : expr3
  2. the expression expr1 is evaluated first. If it is non-zero (true), then the expression expr2 is evaluated, and that is the value of the conditional expression. Otherwise expr3 is evaluated, and that is the value.
### Section 2.12: Precedence and Order of Evaluation:
  1. () [] -> .                                 left to right
  2. ! ~ ++ -- + - * (type) sizeof              right to left
  3. * / %                                      left to right
  4. + -                                        left to right
  5. <<  >>                                     left to right
  6. < <= > >=                                  left to right
  7. == !=                                      left to right
  8. &                                          left to right
  9. ^                                          left to right
  10. |                                         left to right
  11. &&                                        left to right
  12. ||                                        left to right
  13. ?:                                        right to left
  14. = += -= \*= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>=        right to left
  15. ,                                         left to right
  
  16. ðŸ¦†: Any expression involving side-effects such as function calls, increment, decrement, nested assignemnt structures, etc will be executed different order for each compiler.
  
  17. ðŸ‘Œ: The moral is that writing code that depends on order of evaluation is a bad programming practice in any language.
